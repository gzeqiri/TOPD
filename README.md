# TOPD

Technology Over Police Department(TOPD) is a software approach to provide means of communication and organization to the police department. In doing so, our aim is to provide a software in order to ease the communication between different departments in the State Police, a technical approach to the structure of the organization, provide technological means in order to exchange information between links provided between different departments of the organization.
The system will provide a categorized user interface, meaning that the software will strictly follow the hierarchy of the employees, and by doing so we will provide several categories of user that shall login in the system to perform their duties.

The software interface shall be easy to access, even though this will strongly depend in the user category actions that need to be perform and the privileges of that category.
The implementation will be in the format of an web application, the language of programming will be PHP, and the software will be implemented using an PHP framework, Symfony. We are aiming to provide an API format to the software in order to use JavaScript libraries and tools, in order to provide an interactive application and balance the load of each web page. Another reason for this type of implementation is to provide a mean for the system to communicate also with mobile applications, which will be useful, not only to the police department, but we will make possible a communication, between the police and the citizens. Another link will be between police stations or departments and the police employees that are in duty in the streets and need information from the department or from the headquarters.

This is a basic description of the software system that we are striving to build, and new features will be added incrementally to the software specification and development phase.
